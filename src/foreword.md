# Foreword
*by **Quang Huy (aka @LazyYuuki)** and somewhat ChatGPT and Gemini*

Welcome everyone to this workshop on building basic application with LLM, the hot topic of the past year and the next 10 years. You are at the right place!

If there is any feedback, feel free to reach out to me at **@LazyYuuki** on:
- **Telegram**
- **Github**
- **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/buiquanghuy/)**

or through good old email at: **quanghuy@u.nus.edu**

Also do follow [Caviato LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/caviato) for more update on the cool things we are building.

## A bit about myself

My official background is in Electrical Engineering, but to be honest, it is not really for me, at least not in the traditional sense of an Electrical Engineer. I am of a later generation where I am much more into the abstraction layer on the hardware, your embedded development, algorithmic otpimization, computer architecture and computer science as a whole. That is why I embark on a self learning journey with the aim to be better than anyone at what I do (but probably very unlikely so, there is always a bigger fish in the sea hahahaha).

I have a lot of passion in software engineering with a special interest in Open Source Projects, clean code, and software engineering best practices!

My interests in the tech world are as diverse as they come. From the sheer elegance of Rust to the boundless possibilities of JavaScript, from the mind-bending concepts of functional programming to the nifty reproducibility of containerization. And a very weird love and hate relationship with Python and its tooling.

Recently, I've also delved into the intricate world of AI and ML! I love getting my hands dirty with fundamental implementations of these cutting-edge technologies (in Rust preferably)!

Oh, and of course technical documentation. I firmly believe it's the backbone of any successful project, and I take pride in detailed documentation and well-documented code.

So, whether you want to geek out about Rust, explore the wonders of functional programming, chat about containerization, or just have a good ol' tech chit-chat, feel free to hit me up! I'm always up for a fun and educational conversation about anything related to technology!

## Journey into the world of LLM applications

**TLDR**: *I am not that much better than you all. Gen AI is still pretty much a Wild West. Build cool thing with it and share it with everyone.*

You are probably here because you don't want to be left out in this new exciting technological revolution. I would say that this is probably the right choice because from what we have seen in the last few years, this technology is here to stay. Large Language Model and Generative AI in general has already created a massive change in the job landscape for a lot of fields. It is well within your own interests to learn more about how this technology works and get some hand on experience working with it to use it to best of your advantage.

Full disclosure, I have only picked up working with Natural Language Processing and Large Language Model for a few months or so, so in a sense, I am not that far off from you all from a knowledge standpoints. So if you think what I am doing seems complicated and hard to understand, remember that if I can learn it in a few months, then so can you. It is about the perseverance and willingness to learn.

The focus of this workshop is not to make you ready to be accepted into Meta or Google to work on their news LLMs application. This is definitely not enough. In fact, this is barely a grain of sand in this field. However, the main focus is to give you the basic tools and understanding to build simple applications with LLMs. From this basic understanding, you can then explore more tools to help you build more complicated LLMs project, and unlock new usecases and inspire a next generation of tinkerer in this field.

To me, this moment right now is the same as when the web was a new things, the field of Gen AI is still very much a Wild West, and it is up for anyone to grab. So go on and build cool things with it, and remeber to share it with all of us too!
