and of course the link to this book:

*Pshhhh! Don't forget to star us on Github.*

Our objective is simple: Apply Javascript to our prebuilt To Do List template. Although it sounds simple, but I promise you there is a lot more under the hood than it seems. Trust me, it is never as straightforward as it seems.

## What is my assumption for you

I think it would be safe to assume that if you sign up for this workshop, you are somewhat new in the world of web dev and more specifically frontend dev which involves the development of the UI portion of a website or web applications.

I <ins><b>don't have any particular assumptions about your skill levels</b></ins> as this should be a course that anyone can just pick up and learn something new. So no worry, and just have fun.

## What are you supposed to learn at the end of the workshop?

Well hopefully something LOL.

But in more detailed, by the end of the workshop, you should be able to:
- Know what is the DOM?
- Programme some basic Javascript
- Manipulate HTML element with Javascript (JS)
- Use some basic dev tools provided by your native browser to programme Javascript

Alright if you are ready, let get right into the fun part!
