and of course the link to this book:
<a href="https://github.com/edic-nus/intro-to-llm-app-docs" target="_blank">Book</a>

*Pshhhh! Don't forget to star us on Github.*

Our objective is simple: Building a basic unstructured email data extraction tool using Google Gemini LLM API.

## What is my assumption for you

I think it would be safe to assume that if you sign up for this workshop, you are somewhat new in the world of building LLM application and maybe even LLM itself.

I <ins><b>don't have any particular assumptions about your skill levels</b></ins> as this should be a course that anyone can just pick up and learn something new. So no worry, and just have fun.

## What are you supposed to learn at the end of the workshop?

Well hopefully something.

But in more detailed, by the end of the workshop, you should be able to:
- something
- something
- something

Alright if you are ready, let get right into the fun part!
