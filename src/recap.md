# Closing remark

With that we have come to the end of our workshop!!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

To make sure that we consolidate our learning, we can do a quick recap.

## Thank you for joining the workshop

I hope everyone manage to learn something new from this workshop. After this, you can proudly said (to some extent) that you are now officially know how to create a LLM application. Does that make you a ML Engineer I wonder? ðŸ¤” And remember:

> Journey of a thousand miles begin with one step.

So, the key is to just keep practicing, be motivated, be creative and keep building.

I wish you all well and remember to always have fun learning new things, see you in future workshops *if you want to see me again* ðŸ¤£.
